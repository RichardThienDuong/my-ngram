# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task
the problem is to count the occurences of each ascii value and return it in ascii starting order, the challenge is mostly for me the mental barrier of focusing
## Description
yes i have solved it with the help of ethan and the season 1 channel helpers and josh as well.
## Installation
nope installations needed, just needed the right mentality from the break that i took 
## Usage
it creates the arrays to hold the individual values and then counts the occurrences of each and then sorts it in order then prints it
im not sure what to put here its my first time filling this out and not sure what to do. :|
### The Core Team
start project by myself but like all things in life, i finished with the help of many people.
